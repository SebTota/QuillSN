Important: This editor is no longer under development. The Quill QYSIWYG project seems to no longer be active, so my focus has shifted to using TipTap as the WYSIWYG editor of choice. If you would like to continue using QuillSN, please understand it will no longer be developed by me unless a new active fork of Quill is created. For now, check out [TipTapSN](https://github.com/SebTota/TipTapSN).

QuillSN is a note editor built for [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/) using the [Quill](https://github.com/quilljs/quill) WYSIWYG editor. 
It uses the Standard Notes [Editor Kit](https://github.com/standardnotes/editor-kit) to interact with your notes and is one of the few Standard Notes editors to support FileSafe.

## Installation
* Open StandardNotes
* Open the `Extensions` tab on the bottom left
* Click on `Import Extensions`
* Copy and Paste the following link into the `Enter Extensions Link` textbox and click Enter
```
